# Electronic-Control-Unit-for-Electric-Vehicle
This repository contains an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) simulation developed using MATLAB, Simulink, and Stateflow. It includes features like gear mode control, vehicle status monitoring, brake data processing, and CAN communication. The project models essential vehicle functionalities and enables real-time simulation and testing.

## Features
1. Gear Mode Control: Implements logic for shifting gears based on predefined conditions.
2. Vehicle Status Monitoring: Tracks key vehicle parameters such as speed, acceleration, and system health.
3. Brake Data Processing: Simulates brake signal processing, including pressure and pedal position analysis.
4. CAN Communication: Establishes data exchange between different vehicle subsystems using Controller Area Network (CAN).

## System Requirements
1. MATLAB & Simulink (R2022a or later recommended)
2. Stateflow Toolbox
3. Vehicle Network Toolbox (for CAN simulation)

## Installation & Usage
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
2. Open ECU2.slx in Simulink.
3. Run the simulation and observe the outputs in the Scopes and Displays.
4. Modify parameters in the Stateflow charts and Simulink blocks to customize behavior.

## Future Enhancements
1. Integrating Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance.
2. Expanding CAN database for additional vehicle modules.
3. Developing an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) for real-time monitoring.
